**Overview:** <br />
Implemented an interpreter in Python for a language (Brewin) that supports the following functionalities: <br />
* Class Implementation
* Templates
* Constants
* Statements (if, print, return, set, call, while)
* Static Typing (Type Checking, Field Initialization Type Checks, Assignment and Comparison Type Checks, Parameter Passing Type Checks, Returned Value Type Checks)
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Exception Handling <br />

The files are as follows: <br />
* intbase.py, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
* bparser.py, a static parser class to parse Brewin programs
* interpreterv3.py, which delegates work to:
* classv2.py
* objectv2.py
* type_valuev2.py
* env_v2.py

The project was done in 3 parts and the detailed specifications are in Spec1, Spec2 and Spec3.
